	<h2>THIS IS A HEADING</h2>
	<P>this is some text </P>
	<h2>INLINE CSS:<br></h2>
	<p> Quick to apply for small styles and testing.<br>
Cons: Not efficient for larger projects, as it mixes content with presentation and makes maintenance harder.</p>
<h2>EXTERNAL CSS:<br></h2>
<p> Keeps content and presentation separate, easier to maintain and update styles across multiple pages.
Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file.</p>
	<p>Using both inline and external styles appropriately helps in managing and maintaining the styles of your web pages effectively. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask</p>
